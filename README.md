Task 1 of my Java internship at CodTech involves creating a Java program that can read, write, and modify text files. This task is crucial for understanding file handling in Java, which is a fundamental concept in software development. File handling allows a program to interact with external files, enabling data storage, retrieval, and modification. Successfully completing this task will improve my ability to manage files in Java, a skill required in many real-world applications.
To achieve this, I will implement a file handling utility that performs multiple operations on a text file. The first step is to create a program that can open and read a text file. This requires the use of Java classes such as FileReader and BufferedReader, which allow efficient reading of file content. Reading files is essential for applications that need to process stored data dynamically.
Next, I will focus on writing data to a file. This is done using FileWriter and BufferedWriter, which enable writing and appending new content to an existing file. Writing to files is important for logging, data persistence, and user-generated content storage. My program will allow users to enter new text and store it in a file, making it a practical solution for many applications.
Another key aspect of this task is modifying existing file content. Unlike simple reading and writing, modifying files requires reading the current content, making necessary changes, and then rewriting the updated content back to the file. This process can be handled by reading the file line by line, modifying specific lines based on conditions, and then saving the modified content back to the file. Java provides multiple ways to achieve this, including using temporary files or storing data in memory before rewriting.
Exception handling is an essential part of this task. File operations are prone to errors, such as missing files, permission issues, or incorrect file paths. Therefore, I will implement exception handling using try-catch blocks to manage these errors effectively. This ensures that the program does not crash and provides meaningful error messages to users.
To maintain good coding practices, I will document my script thoroughly by adding proper comments. This will help in understanding the logic behind each function and make it easier for others to review or modify the code in the future. Proper documentation is a crucial aspect of professional coding, as it enhances readability and maintainability.
